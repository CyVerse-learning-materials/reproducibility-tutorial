**Reproducibility Tour**
============================

Goal
----

This tutorial is intended to give you a "tour" of how you can build your own
reproducible analyses utilizing CyVerse resources. In reality, building a
reproducible workflow could take days, weeks, or longer. This short look will
point out some tools and resources you can use along your path.

      - |Atmosphere Image|
      - Large2 size recommended

**Other Installations**

    .. Note::

						 In most cases, we will be installing these tools on Atmosphere
						 instances. This tutorial is mostly command line. If using your own
						 computer you will need a terminal already installed on Linux or
						 mac). If you are using Windows, please see the instructions for
						 installing the |Windows Linux Subsystem|.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Prerequisite
      - Notes
      - Links
    * - Docker
      - Docker is a technology for running individual software tools in a
        reproducible environment, and on any machine. We request you install
        The **Desktop, Community Edition** of Docker if you are using
        Windows or MacOS. The **Docker CE x86_64** instructions are also
        available for Linux users. If you have installation problems, we
        will also have backup cloud instances available.
      - |Download Docker|
    * - Git
      - Git is a version control software.
        If you are using Linux or MacOS, you most likely already have Git.
        Windows users may need to install Git. You can find instructions
        for Git installation at the link.
      - |Install Git|
    * - Text editor
      - You will need to have a text editor suitable for working with code
        (*Not* Microsoft word, or other word processing software).
      - We recommend |Atom|
    * - Jupyter lab
      - Jupyter is a popular data science workbench for reproducible analysis
      - |Install Juypyter lab|
    * - Windows Linux Subsystem (Windows PC only)
      - This enables using Linux on Windows 10 PCs
      - We suggested installing the |Windows Linux Subsystem| if you have
        a Windows 10 PC. Following the directions we also suggest
        installing  an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS distribution.

Input and example data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this tutorial, we will be assembling the genome of the protozoan
Plasmodium falciparum - the parasite that causes malaria. We will be
importing data from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive.
